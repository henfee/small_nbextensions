# small_nbextensions

This repo contains some small javascript for IPython/Jupyter notebook. Usually, these extensions will 
also be uploaded to the main collection [https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions). 
Extensions include:

- [highlighter](https://github.com/jfbercher/small_nbextensions/tree/master/usability/highlighter): this extension enables to highlight selected 
portions of text in a markdown cell. This is useful (eg for students) to annotate important parts of a text/notebook.
- [interactive_sols](https://github.com/jfbercher/small_nbextensions/tree/master/usability/interactive_sols): this extension enables to mask/unmask solutions or tips cells. This is useful eg to let students work on an exercise before looking at a possible solution or hints.


Of course, do not miss my big extension [latex_envs](https://github.com/jfbercher/latex_envs) which enables to use some LaTeX strutures (eg theorems/itemize/etc) directly in the notebook. It also features automatic numerotation, labels and references, and some support for (bibTeX) bibliography.
